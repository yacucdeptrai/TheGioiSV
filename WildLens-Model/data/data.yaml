# Unified dataset config for WildLens (centralized)
# Dataset is organized per-species under WildLens-Model/data/<Species>/{train,valid,test}/
# Ultralytics supports multiple paths per split; we aggregate all species splits below.

# Paths are relative to this YAML file's location (WildLens-Model/data/)
